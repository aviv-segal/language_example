# Language example

this is an example programming language in order to teach how to make programming languages. It is intentionally very simple, and is under 300 lines of code.
If you're intrested in learning how to create programming languages feel free to read my article here: https://oriraisfeld.vercel.app/articles/How-to-write-a-programming-language

## extra nots
theres no licensing for this project. If you want to do anything with it, go ahead (I would be happy to recieve some credit though). 
I put less than an hour of effort into this language so I don't really plan on doing anything with it.
feel free to ask questions in the issues section of this repo.
